Create a Spring Boot Starter Project with the following modules:
Add Spring Web ,actuator and Security dependencies.
Add Eureka Client dependency.
Add JWT dependency to pom.xml


Add @EnableEurekaClient to  Spring Boot Application class 

Create A DTO record AuthRequest  with fields username, password.

Create a class JwtUtil with methods to generate JwtToken Inject the 
secret key and expiration time with @Value annotation from application.properties file.
Add One More Field jwt.security.key Key 
Add init method with @PostConstruct annotation inititalze the key using HMAC-SHA algorithm.
Use the following code to initialize the key:
     this.key = Keys.hmacShaKeyFor(secret.getBytes());
Create method generateToken with parameter AuthRequest and return type String.
 Use Jwts.builder() to build the token with subject,issuedAt, expiration and signWith methods and compact it.

 
Create a class SecurityConfig and Register AuthenticationManager,BcryptPasswordEncoder ,SecurityFilterChain,UserDetailsService as bean
Add Appropriate Code to Register the bean
Add appropriate security configurations to permit /auth/** endpoints 
and secure other endpoints.

Expose a POST endpoint /auth/login which accepts AuthRequest as request body.
Inject JwtUtil and AuthenticationManager using @Autowired annotation.
In the login method authenticate the user using AuthenticationManager.
If authentication is successful generate the token using JwtUtil and return it in ResponseEntity.

Create application.properties file with following properties:
server.port=8080
eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka/
jwt.security.key=your_secret_key_here
jwt.expiration.time=3600000
spring.application.name=auth-service
# Add actuator endpoint to monitor the application
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
Test the application by sending a POST request to /auth/login endpoint with valid username and password.
